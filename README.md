# Reflection

Cryptoverse is a personal project inspired by a series on Youtube. The goal of this project is to create a web application that dynamically displays data from the CoinRanking API on RapidAPI.com. This includes market data, the top 50 coins and each coin's price history.

Cryoptoverse had a few challenges, as this was one of my earliest projects. As a beginner, learning about dynamic rendering was tricky, as this API has a lot of data to unpack. Including impactful content in the application was also tricky, but ultimately the ChartJs price-history chart made up for a lot content-wise.

At the end of the day, the main technologies used to create this project are React, React-Router, and ChartJs `create-react-app` boilerplate was used to minimize setup time and reduce initial confusions when starting an app..
